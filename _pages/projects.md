**VARIPOL**
* <b>Linguistic VARIeties and POLitical Boundaries in the French-speaking World</b>
* <b>Financement</b>: Projet Émergence – Alliance Sorbonne Université
* <b>Porteur</b>: Marc CHALIER
* <b>Durée</b>: 09/2025-08/2027
* <b>Description</b>:

The project “Linguistic VARIeties and POLitical Boundaries in the French-speaking World” (VARIPOL) examines the influence of political borders on the perceptions and representations of French varieties in three border regions in Europe, Canada and Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses three key research questions:

  * Which varieties of French do speakers distinguish in their local linguistic space?
  * Do political borders influence the representations and perceptions of these boundaries?
  * Do idealized representations align with perceptions based on concrete auditory stimuli?  

The methodology involves mental maps, phonetic-phonological analyses of linguistic productions in different communication situations, and perception experiments. The project aims to fill a gap in perceptual linguistics by systematically studying the impact of political borders on varietal boundaries, focusing on often overlooked francophone areas.
